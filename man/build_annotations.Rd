\title{A function to build annotations from TxDb.* and AnnotationHub resources}
\usage{
build_annotations(genome, annotations)
}
\arguments{
\item{genome}{The genome assembly.}

\item{annotations}{A character vector of annotations to build. Valid annotation codes are listed with \code{builtin_annotations()}. The "basicgenes" shortcut builds the following regions: 1-5Kb upstream of TSSs, promoters, 5UTRs, exons, introns, and 3UTRs. The "cpgs" shortcut builds the following regions: CpG islands, shores, shelves, and interCGI regions. NOTE: Shortcuts need to be appended by the genome, e.g. \code{hg19_basicgenes}.
Custom annotations whose names are of the form \code{[genome]_custom_[name]} should also be included. Custom annotations should be read in and converted to \code{GRanges} with \code{read_annotations()}. They can be for a \code{supported_genome()}, or for an unsupported genome.}
}
\value{
A \code{GRanges} object of all the \code{annotations} combined. The \code{mcols} are \code{id, tx_id, gene_id, symbol, type}. The \code{id} column is a unique name, the \code{tx_id} column is either a UCSC knownGene transcript ID (genic annotations) or a Ensembl transcript ID (lncRNA annotations), the \code{gene_id} is the Entrez ID, the \code{symbol} is the gene symbol from the \code{org.*.eg.db} mapping from the Entrez ID, and the \code{type} is of the form \code{[genome]_[type]_[name]}.
}
\description{
Create a \code{GRanges} object consisting of all the desired \code{annotations}. Supported annotation codes are listed by \code{builtin_annotations()}. The basis for enhancer annotations are FANTOM5 data, the basis for CpG related annotations are CpG island tracks from \code{AnnotationHub}, and the basis for genic annotations are from the \code{TxDb.*} and \code{org.db} group of packages.
